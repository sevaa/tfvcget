This extension doesn't collect any information about the user, the project,
or the user's Azure DevOps instance.

Since it collects nothing, it doesn't share anything with either the extension author
or any third parties. Usage data collection that is performed by Azure DevOps
itself, or the public Extension Gallery, is not of extension author's doing and
therefore not their responsibility.
